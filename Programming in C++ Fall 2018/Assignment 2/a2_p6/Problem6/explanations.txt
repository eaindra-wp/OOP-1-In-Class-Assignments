Problem 2.6 (a)
When "using namespace std" is commented out, all functions included 
in the library cannot be used anymore.
The error messages indicate that getline, cout, string, endl, cin are not
declared in the scope. So, it means that these functions are not checked
whether they are included in the library or not and they do not work properly
anymore.
So, if we still want to use those functions without "using namespace std", 
we will have to write "std::cout", "std:: cin" and so on. 

Problem 2.6 (b)
If "Critter::" is removed from the functions,  the error messages show that 
the void functions are not declared in the Critter.cpp. Since 
these two variables are declared in the header file, the connection(namespace)
is lost if we remove "Critter::" from the functions. 
So, if we don't want to use this method, we can build a constructor, overload
the constructor.
